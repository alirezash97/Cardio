## General info
This project aims to classify ECG signals into four categories, normal rhythm, atrial fibrillation rhythm, other rhythm, and noisy recording. 
We use [The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/) as a primary dataset for this task, but since it does not contain enough samples, we use the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/) as well.
