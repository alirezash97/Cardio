## General info
This project aims to classify ECG signals into four categories, normal rhythm, atrial fibrillation rhythm, other rhythm, and noisy recording. 
We used [The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/) as a primary dataset for this task, but since it does not contain enough samples, we used the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/) as well.

## Techniques
* Data Cleaning
* Data Balancing
* Data Augmentation

## Technologies
* Python
* Tensorflow/keras
* Pandas 
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn


P.s. In June 2020, this project was completed; recent commits have been devoted to organizing it.
